# ChatBot
The ChatBot Project

Features of the Carbot:
1. Talk Naturally with the User(Uses NLP API)
 - The API is pretty smart and basically has intellectual responces to your queries.This is a great API that we decided to intergrate     when the user wants to talk casually and not about cars.

2. Suggest You a car by searching the Database
    - Our code finds the difference between different day to day terms . For example:
     A User Input= Family Car 
     Response-Sedan Is Best for you!
      
     B User input- Cheap car with space for family and good storage.
     Response- Alright! I think Hatchback is the best for you .Additionally, I searched only diesel because you mentioned cheap.
    

3. Book you a mechanic Call/Email.
- Uses Selenium to auto complete and embedd user responce to the webpage.

4. Provide you a quote and payment option for your car repair/maintainance.
 - Uses Selenium to do all the automation clicks and press to get you a quote.
 
5. Use an image API to search spectifc terms.
 - Searches an Image on Bing and responds with a .jpg file. Uses microsoft asure api.

6. Using Selenium Allow you to sell your car at buyanycar.
